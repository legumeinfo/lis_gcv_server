# OpenAPI Specification Files

This directory contains `.yaml` files for [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) that define structured data types that may be used by the microservices in this repository and the clients that interact with them.
Each `.yaml` file is individually versioned (i.e. MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
Developers should refer to this repository's Wiki to learn how these files are [versioned](https://github.com/legumeinfo/microservices/wiki/Tagging-Releases-and-Automated-Builds) and [organized](https://github.com/legumeinfo/microservices/wiki/Protocol-Buffers) before using them.
